            <h2>The Evolution of Maldivian Language</h2>
            <p>The Maldivian language, Dhivehi, has a rich history influenced by various cultures over the centuries. It is an Indo-Aryan language spoken by the Maldivian people and uses the unique Thaana script. Dhivehi has evolved through significant cultural and historical changes, reflecting the diverse influences that have shaped the Maldives.</p>

            <h3>Eveyla Akuru</h3>
            <p>Early forms of the Maldivian script, Eveyla Akuru, were found on Buddhist relics dating back to the 6th century AD. These scripts are indicative of the early Buddhist influence in the Maldives. The Eveyla Akuru script was used for inscriptions on coral stone and copper plates. This script further developed into what is known as Dhives Akuru by the 17th century.</p>

            <h3>Dhives Akuru</h3>
            <p>Dhives Akuru was used extensively in the Maldives until the end of the 17th century and into the early 18th century. This script was primarily used for official and religious documents. Dhives Akuru represents a significant period in Maldivian history when local governance and literary activities were flourishing. The script's influence is seen in numerous inscriptions and documents from that era.</p>

            <h3>Thaana Akuru</h3>
            <p>The Thaana script, modified from existing Thaana script, began to replace Dhives Akuru around 1780 AD. This change was part of a broader cultural shift within the Maldives. Thaana Akuru was created using Arabic numerals as a base, reflecting the Islamic influence after the conversion of the Maldives to Islam in the 12th century. Thaana script is still in use today and remains an integral part of Maldivian identity, utilized in everyday communication, education, and government documentation.</p>
