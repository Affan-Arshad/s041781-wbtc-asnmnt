            <h2>The Spiritual Heritage of the Maldives</h2>
            <p>Before the introduction of Islam in 1153 AD, the Maldives was heavily influenced by Buddhism and Hinduism. Today, Islam is the state religion, deeply influencing Maldivian daily life and culture. The transition from Buddhism to Islam marked a significant shift in the religious and cultural landscape of the Maldives.</p>

            <p>Islamic teachings and practices, including prayers, fasting (Ramadan), and pilgrimage (Hajj), became integral parts of Maldivian culture, blending with existing traditions to create a unique Islamic identity in the archipelago.</p>
